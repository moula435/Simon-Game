# 🎮 Simon Game

This is a simple **Simon Game** made with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 🧠 What is this game?

Simon Game is a memory game where you must **remember and repeat a pattern of colors**. The game shows a sequence of light, and you have to click the same colors in the same order. Each round, the pattern gets longer and harder. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

2. **Press any key** to start. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
3. The game will show a color light and sound.  
4. **Click the same color in the same order**.  
5. If you are correct, the game adds one more color to the pattern.  
6. Try to repeat the full pattern every time and get a high score! :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## 🚀 Why I made this

I built this project to **practice JavaScript logic, DOM handling, and front-end skills**. It helped me understand game loops, events, and user interaction.

Feel free to explore the code and try improving it!
